# Sport Quiz

## Description
This is a timed quiz over sport events and awards that have happened in the the past three years. This quiz was built using HTML for the page, CSS for the styling and color, and JavaScript for the functionality of the questions and timer. There are a total of 10 questions for users to answer.

The quiz has features that will display green if the user answers correctly and red if the user answers incorrectly. If the user answers correctly it will add time to the timer. If the user answers incorrectly the quiz will deduct time from the timer.

Once the user runs out of time a page will display say "Time is up" with a restart quiz button, as well.
